- How to modify in place


- Define legal moves (+ hints: all legal moves)
- Flipping operation
- Board storage: 2D array or map:
> probably 2D array is the way to go, since eventually it will be nxn
> will only save memory at first, also harder to do operations?
> no, if we keep it as ordered hash set, then operations is doable!!!
> also save cost for checking (actually both is equal?)
> keep track of frequency map for final as well? (or count later?)
